How can i use git worktrees to work on multiple branches at once?

======
Git worktrees allow you to have multiple working directories for a single repository, each with a different branch checked out. This is useful when you want to work on multiple branches simultaneously without having to switch branches or stash changes. Here's how you can use git worktrees:

1. Create a new worktree:
   ```
   git worktree add <path> <branch>
   ```
   This creates a new worktree at the specified path and checks out the specified branch.

   Example:
   ```
   git worktree add ../feature-branch feature
   ```

2. List existing worktrees:
   ```
   git worktree list
   ```

3. Navigate to the new worktree:
   ```
   cd <path>
   ```

4. Work on the branch in the new worktree as you normally would.

5. When you're done with a worktree, you can remove it:
   ```
   git worktree remove <path>
   ```

6. If you want to create a new branch and a worktree for it in one step:
   ```
   git worktree add -b <new-branch> <path> <start-point>
   ```

   Example:
   ```
   git worktree add -b new-feature ../new-feature-branch main
   ```

Here's a practical workflow:

1. You're working on the main branch in your primary working directory.

2. You need to work on a feature branch:
   ```
   git worktree add ../feature-branch feature
   ```

3. You also need to fix a bug on a separate branch:
   ```
   git worktree add ../bugfix-branch bugfix
   ```

4. Now you have three working directories:
   - Your original directory with main branch
   - ../feature-branch with the feature branch
   - ../bugfix-branch with the bugfix branch

5. You can work on all three simultaneously, switching between directories as needed.

6. When you're done with a branch, you can remove its worktree:
   ```
   git worktree remove ../feature-branch
   ```

Remember, all worktrees share the same repository, so commits made in one worktree are immediately visible in all others. This allows you to easily integrate changes between branches.

Using worktrees can significantly improve your workflow when you need to work on multiple branches simultaneously, especially on larger projects or when you need to context-switch frequently.
