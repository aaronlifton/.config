## Rg regex help (`-e`)

```
When searching with rg, with the options `--column --line-number --no-heading --color=always --smart-case --max-columns=4096 -e`, what would be the syntax for the regexp pattern to search for any line that begins with `import` and  has `automation` somewhere after it?
```
