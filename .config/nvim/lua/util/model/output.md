What are some creative ways to display groundingContext from google gemini API?

====== Grounding in generative AI connects the model's output to verifiable information sources, which helps reduce
fabricated content and improves accuracy and reliability. The Gemini API offers grounding with sources like Google
Search and your own data via Vertex AI Search.

Here are some creative ways to display the grounding context from the Google Gemini API:

**Integrating Source Information Directly:**

- **Inline Citations:** The Gemini API can provide inline attributions, directly citing the sources within the generated
  response. This allows users to see exactly where each piece of information originates as they read.
- **Hover or Click for Details:** When displaying the generated text, make the portions that are grounded in external
  sources interactive. Users could hover over or click on these sections to reveal the specific source snippet or link
  that supports that part of the response. This provides transparency without cluttering the main text.

**Visualizing Grounding:**

- **Color-Coding or Highlighting:** Different colors or highlighting could be used to indicate parts of the response
  that are strongly grounded, weakly grounded, or not grounded in the provided context. This gives users a visual cue
  about the confidence level of different parts of the answer.
- **Source Sidebars or Panels:** A dedicated section next to the generated text could display the relevant source
  documents or snippets. As the user reads through the response, the corresponding source information could be
  highlighted or scrolled to in the sidebar, creating a dynamic link between the text and its origins.
- **Knowledge Graphs or Network Diagrams:** For complex responses drawing from multiple sources, visualize the
  connections between the generated text and the grounding sources as a knowledge graph. This could show how different
  pieces of information from various sources were combined to form the final answer. This might be particularly useful
  for data summarization or generating visualizations.
- **Confidence Scores:** The API provides grounding scores that indicate how well an answer is grounded. This score can
  be displayed numerically or visually (e.g., a confidence bar) to give users a sense of the reliability of the
  generated content.

**Interactive Exploration:**

- **Expandable Source Snippets:** Instead of just providing links, display a brief snippet from the source directly
  below the relevant sentence or paragraph in the generated text. An "expand" option could reveal more of the source
  document.
- **Guided Source Exploration:** Allow users to click on a grounded section of text and be guided through the source
  material that supports it. This could involve highlighting the relevant parts of the source document or providing a
  summarized view of the source.
- **"Ask the Source" Feature:** For grounded information, provide a feature that allows users to ask follow-up questions
  specifically about the source document used.

**Beyond Text:**

- **Visual Grounding in Images/Videos:** For multimodal applications, grounding can involve connecting text descriptions
  to specific regions in images or videos. This could be displayed by highlighting or bounding boxes around the relevant
  visual elements as the corresponding text is read.
- **Generating Visualizations from Grounded Data:** Tools like LIDA can use natural language summaries of data as
  grounding context to automatically generate visualizations. Displaying the generated visualizations alongside the data
  summary and the prompt that led to their creation could be a creative way to show the grounding process.

By implementing some of these creative display methods, you can make the grounding context from the Gemini API more
transparent, informative, and engaging for users, enhancing trust and understanding of the AI's output.
